#### Introduction

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.


#### Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they 
expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the 
main questions theyâ€™d like to answer:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

#### Data

The analysis was conducted using the Rockbuster relational database management system and PostgreSQL. The dataset contains information about Rockbuster's movies, customers, payments, stores, staff, actors, rental history, and addresses.
